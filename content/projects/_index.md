I set up this website (see [about](/about)) to sharpen my web skills and gradually build a portfolio. Recently, I started to learn typescript/react with [this cute retro bingo](/projects/retrobingo).

At 42, I am currently working on Webserv: building a HTTP server from scratch in C++. We’ve already built [other fun stuff too](/projects/cub3d).


After hours I am working on a [crossword-style board game](https://github.com/solargc/krabbels). More on that soon.
