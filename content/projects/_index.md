At 42, I am currently busy with the C++ modules and Webserv.

Recently I set up this website (see [about](/about)) to hone my web skills and gradually build a portfolio. I am currently learning typescript/react, I just build [this](/projects/retrobingo).

After hours I am working on a [crossword-style board game](https://github.com/solargc/krabbels).  
More on this soon.
