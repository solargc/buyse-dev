A minimal shell written in C.

<img src="/projects/minishell.jpg" alt="minishell" class="show">

 We enjoyed learning about:
- Lexer and parser implementation
- Command execution in a Unix environment
- Pipes and redirections
- Environment variables
- Error handling and memory management
- Signal handling
- C project structure and Makefiles

For this team project, we followed a strict git workflow and used git pull requests. The shell follows Bash's behavior.

The code is [here](https://github.com/solargc/minishell).  
A Nix dev shell is provided with depencies if you want to run locally.
