I built a small bingo game.
<iframe

  style="width: clamp(300px, 70vh, 90%); aspect-ratio: 1/1; min-height: 650px"

What I learned:

- Init a modern frontend (Vite/React/Ts)
- TypeScript syntax (coming from C and Rust, types are a blessing)
- React sauce: components, props, state, project structure
- Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm
- Modern css, dark themed, responsive layout
- From scratch to deployment as a static website

Images are llm-generated, with nostalgic Caribbean a&nbsp;e&nbsp;s&nbsp;t&nbsp;h&nbsp;e&nbsp;t&nbsp;i&nbsp;c&nbsp;s.   
Claude Code for boilerplate, CSS tinkering, syntax learning.
